                <h2>We aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world</h2>
                <p>Riot Games was founded in 2006 to create games and experiences that make it better to be a player. In 2009, we launched our debut title, League of Legends, which has gone on to be one of the most-played PC games in the world. In the years since, we’ve released VALORANT, Teamfight Tactics, Legends of Runeterra, and League of Legends: Wild Rift. Our titles are played in some of the most widely recognized esports in the world, culminating in events like the League of Legends World Championship and VALORANT Champions, which are watched by millions of fans each year. We’ve also expanded our IP through projects across music, comic books, board games, and Arcane, our Emmy-winning animated series.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur Tokyo office delivers Riot’s games, esports, and entertainment with holistic and hyper-local creative expressions in Japan. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJapan has deep roots in gaming culture. Many of the genres, games, and communities that have defined decades of gaming expansion were created or inspired by Japanese games. Our Tokyo office honors that deep gaming tradition by making sure Riot’s games are tailored specifically for Japanese players. Our job is to listen, learn, and engage with local players so we can all grow together. </p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur St. Louis office is dedicated to building the infrastructure of our games, supporting key projects, and being a home for midwestern Rioters. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur presence in St. Louis dates back to the earliest days of the company. From when Riot was founded in 2006, to when League of Legends launched in 2009, to when the game grew to become the most played PC game in the world a few years later, engineering Rioters in St. Louis wrote crucial code that shaped the formative platforms and systems of the game. </p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur Shanghai office is not only the headquarters of our Riot Games China publishing presence, but also houses a development studio which provides a strategic competitive edge to help us develop the best games for our players in China and around the world. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur new Shanghai Office is located in downtown Shanghai with a stunning view of the Bund. The Shanghai office opened in 2015 with just 20 Rioters and has grown substantially over the following years with over 200 full time Rioters today. With the launch of Shanghai Game Studio in 2021 and expansion of the China Game Studio Group in 2022, that growth is only continuing as we look to bring on more talent to create incredible games that will last for decades. </p>
