          <h1>THE GREATEST HITS PLAYLIST OF TFT MECHANICS</h1>
          <p class="sub">
            Headliner, Portals, and more! Remix Rumble is bringing the greatest
            hits of mechanics to TFT!
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            It wouldn’t be a new set without a mechanics update, and for a set
            where you’re in charge of making your own mix, we’re giving you the
            greatest hits (of TFT mechanics) to mix with. Headliner brings an
            updated version of a fan favorite mechanic, Chosen, into the modern
            world of TFT. Portals continue for another set to make each stage
            feel different. Augments sound off with over 40 new beats Augments
            to play with. We’re taking TFT to LEVEL 10, alongside some changes
            to the number of units in the pool, drop odds, and more! With so
            much to get into, queue up your favorite (reading) playlist and
            let’s get going!

          <h2>Headliner</h2>
          <p>
            Headliners in TFT are the revamped version of Chosen units, offering
            a fresh twist to the gameplay. Purchased at 2-stars from the shop,
            they provide an extra +1 towards a specific trait and boast unique
            Headliner bonuses. Unlike Chosen, every shop now features a
            Headliner, eliminating the randomness of encountering them. Plus,
            even if you already have one, new Headliners appear every fourth
            shop, allowing for strategic pivots and upgrades throughout the
            game. Remember, to acquire a new Headliner, you'll need to sell your
            current one. This updated mechanic adds depth and strategic
            complexity to TFT, fostering memorable gameplay experiences and
            "that one game I had..." stories.

          <h2>Updated Portals</h2>
          <p>
            In Remix Rumble, Portals play a supporting role to the main focus on
            Headliners, offering game-altering effects with a more
            straightforward design and nomenclature. Unlike their predecessors
            in Runeterra Reforged, which could be complex and game-defining, the
            Portals in Remix Rumble have a lower ceiling of impact. While still
            capable of significantly altering gameplay dynamics, they're
            designed to be easier to understand and remember. This shift allows
            for greater flexibility to introduce and adjust Portals throughout
            the set or future iterations, ensuring a balanced and engaging
            experience for players.

        <div class="content">
          <h2>New Augments</h2>
          <p>
            In Remix Rumble, Augments continue to play a crucial role in shaping
            the distinctiveness of each game. With over 40 new Augments and
            several returning from previous sets, players are provided with a
            diverse array of tools to explore and experiment with. The focus is
            on striking a balance between introducing exciting and deep Augments
            while avoiding those that overly dictate specific compositions or
            become too complex for casual players to enjoy. Whether you're drawn
            to the unconventional or prefer straightforward stat boosts, there's
            something for everyone among the Augments. Take, for instance, the
            wildly innovative "Blank Slate," just one example of the myriad
            possibilities awaiting players in Remix Rumble.
